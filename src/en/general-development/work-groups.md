# Work Groups

Work-groups are responsible for their respective areas of the game's design and documentation, similar to Code-Owners which manage the implementations of specific areas. Work-groups are made up of maintainers who have relevant experience in their specific area.

These groups maintain two kinds of documents:
* **Design Guidelines**, which outline the design principles and the overarching goal of that area.
* **PR Guidelnines**, which outline the criteria for pull requests in that area.

If you have a question about something related to one of the department/game areas, feel free to message a member of its work-group to get an authoritative answer. 

Maintainers that are not part of any work-groups are considered generalists, and while they might not be fully up to date with the design of a specific part, they can still help answer questions.

## For Maintainers

Work-groups are non exclusive, you can be in as many or as few as you want, however you should expect to be able to answer questions and be involved in the design of the area's that you have selected.

You can review any PR, regardless of the work-group. However, make sure that you read up on the relevant guidelines written by the work-group before doing a review. Ideally, you should still only review areas that you have experience in, but it is fine to merge something as long as it fits the design and meets the guidelines. 

To keep the work-group information accurate, add yourself to the list if you plan on being actively involved in a work-group for a sustained period. Alternatively, if you leave a work-group and don't intend to return, please remove yourself from the list.
